            1. Primary:
            The primary stage would cover children in classes I to V (6 - 11 age-group). The Committee felt that at the
            primary stage “the child's spontaneity, curiosity, creativity and activity, should not be restricted by a
            rigid and unattractive method of teaching and environment for learning”. It is also expected that the child
            should develop a respect for national symbols like the flag and the anthem. The child should learn the first
            language which should generally be the mother tongue, appreciate the dignity of labour.

        <div class="media"> 2. Middle:
            The middle stage is to consist of classes VI to VIII (11-14 age group). At this stage children face
            adjustment problems in the family as well as in society. As such the committee felt that the curriculum for
            this age group should take into account the social demands especially in the case of girls. The objectives
            of the education for the middle stage continue to be the same as in the previous stage but they operate at
            “higher level of complexity, involving greater knowledge, deeper understanding and a grasp of principles.

        <div class="media"> 3. Lower Secondary:
            The lower secondary stage consisting of classes IX and X (14-16 age group) is the terminal stage of 10 years
            of general education. At this stage emphasis is given on work experience, and this is the time when skills
            and attitudes should be brought to a satisfactory level of development. The Education Commission had urged
            for a minimum national standard of attainment at this stage, so that all sections of the community could
            come up and face the world of competition.
